If the&#10;terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to&#10;make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek&#10;a different licensing arrangement.&#10;&#10;Definitions&#10;&#10;    &quot;Copyright Holder&quot; means the individual(s) or organization(s)&#10;    named in the copyright notice for the entire Package.&#10;&#10;    &quot;Contributor&quot; means any party that has contributed code or other&#10;    material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's&#10;    procedures.&#10;&#10;    &quot;You&quot; and &quot;your&quot; means any person who would like to copy,&#10;    distribute, or modify the Package.&#10;&#10;    &quot;Package&quot; means the collection of files distributed by the&#10;    Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of&#10;    those files.

It does not mean licensing fees.&#10;&#10;    &quot;Standard Version&quot; refers to the Package if it has not been&#10;    modified, or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested&#10;    by the Copyright Holder.&#10;&#10;    &quot;Modified Version&quot; means the Package, if it has been changed, and&#10;    such changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright&#10;    Holder.&#10;&#10;    &quot;Original License&quot; means this Artistic License as Distributed with&#10;    the Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as&#10;    it may be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.&#10;&#10;    &quot;Source&quot; form means the source code, documentation source, and&#10;    configuration files for the Package.&#10;&#10;    &quot;Compiled&quot; form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary,&#10;    or any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or&#10;    translation of the Source form.&#10;&#10;&#10;Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution&#10;&#10;(1)  You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use&#10;Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that&#10;you do not Distribute the Modified Version.&#10;&#10;&#10;Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version&#10;&#10;(2)  You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the&#10;Standard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction,&#10;either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate&#10;all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.  At&#10;your discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a&#10;Compiled form of the Package.&#10;&#10;(3)  You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other&#10;modifications made available from the Copyright Holder.  The resulting&#10;Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such&#10;will be subject to the Original License.&#10;&#10;&#10;Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source&#10;&#10;(4)  You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis&#10;or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the&#10;Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs&#10;from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting&#10;any non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that&#10;you do at least ONE of the following:&#10;&#10;    (a)  make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder&#10;    of the Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the&#10;    Copyright Holder may include your modifications in the Standard&#10;    Version.&#10;&#10;    (b)  ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not&#10;    prevent the user installing or running the Standard Version.

Such instructions must be&#10;valid at the time of your distribution.  If these instructions, at any&#10;time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you&#10;must provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution.&#10;If you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty&#10;days after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then&#10;you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.&#10;&#10;(6)  You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without&#10;the Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to&#10;the Source of the Modified Version.&#10;&#10;&#10;Aggregating or Linking the Package&#10;&#10;(7)  You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or&#10;Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting&#10;aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the&#10;Package.  Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other&#10;components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license&#10;apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions&#10;as included in the aggregation.&#10;&#10;(8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with&#10;other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to&#10;build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that&#10;include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction,&#10;provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.&#10;&#10;&#10;Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version&#10;&#10;(9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that&#10;merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause&#10;the Package to be a Modified Version.  In addition, such works are not&#10;considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the&#10;terms of this license.&#10;&#10;&#10;General Provisions&#10;&#10;(10)  Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or&#10;Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using,&#10;modifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not&#10;use, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this&#10;license.&#10;&#10;(11)  If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified&#10;Version made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required&#10;to ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of&#10;this license.&#10;&#10;(12)  This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark,&#10;service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.&#10;&#10;(13)  This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide,&#10;free-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell,&#10;sell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any&#10;patent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily&#10;infringed by the Package. If you institute patent litigation&#10;(including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging&#10;that the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent&#10;infringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the&#10;date that such litigation is filed.&#10;&#10;(14)  Disclaimer of Warranty:&#10;THE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS &quot;AS&#10;IS' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES. THE IMPLIED&#10;WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR&#10;NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY YOUR LOCAL&#10;LAW. UNLESS REQUIRED BY LAW, NO COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR CONTRIBUTOR WILL&#10;BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL&#10;DAMAGES ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THE PACKAGE, EVEN IF&#10;ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE." />
